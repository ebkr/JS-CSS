# JS-CSS
Write CSS using JavaScript without a framework.

### Why?
There are a few reasons I can think of.
1. Modularity - You can customise elements outside of the CSS area, and reuse those parts in other areas.
2. Compatibility - Works on IE and Edge, removes the need for a preprocessor to use variables.
3. Conditionals - Deliver custom themes, or style specific elements before delivering content.

### But the file size is larger!
Well, considering it's ~2KBs in size, there shouldn't be any noticeable performance hit. The code also delivers minified\* CSS to the webpage.
Isn't it also worth all those extra possibilities?
